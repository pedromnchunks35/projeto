\section{Architecture}
\quad Why is architecture important?

  An architecture in distributed system's can be very much of an increment of value, because:

  It ensures that good practises are followed, what we mean by this is that by thinking more about how an system could be contructed, we will try to understand which details we need to think off, in order to have an more well designed distributed system.

  It is tought, according to previous experiences of more influent people, because when we search uppon what could be the best to our idealization of system, we end up reading books and articles of more experienced people experiences and workovers.

  We will not invent the wheels in some cases, this means that you may found some patterns for your architecture that you can follow and still be sure that the system will acomplish what you want to acomplish. What you may not found in one pattern, you can find in an composite of patters, by mixing them. Also, you can always take out ideas from them and use what you think is more advantegous for your system.

  Finally, you will have a more robustness system, because by thinking and planning the system out will ensure that most of the cases will be tought and eventually take cared of.
