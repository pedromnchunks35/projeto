\section{Cost}

\quad The cost of implementing and maintaining a distributed system of face recognition can be high, especially if it is a large-scale system. Therefore, it is important to prioritize what is most important for the business. 

Is it worth investing in the most expensive software to ensure maximum accuracy for the model, or is it more important to have less latency even if it results in some loss of accuracy? 

Alternatively, should both factors be considered, with budget not being a constraint? 

In this perspective, the cost of implementation is exponential, given that complex models are hard to train and time-consuming. Therefore, it is necessary to use the best software available.

The overall budget for this project can range from 165,000 to 265,000 euros. This budget is broken down into several categories, including human resources (20,000 euros), cameras (50,000 euros), servers (25,000 euros), network infrastructure (20,000 euros), software licenses (10,000 euros), and maintenance, training, and support (10,000 euros). Additionally, there is an optional expense for GPUs, which can range from 10,000 to 100,000 euros. These costs will enable us to complete the project efficiently and provide better service to our clients. The budget will be closely monitored to ensure that we stay within our financial constraints.
