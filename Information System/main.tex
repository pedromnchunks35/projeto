\section{Information System}
When there is a big game for example, when it comes to Portuguese football, 
when Porto and Benfica play with each other, there is always a huge line of people to enter the stadium,
 some of those supporters are, what we  call partners of the club, that is they bought special passes 
 that let them watch every game of the respective team they support. But event tought they are special 
 supporters they have to wait in the same line as the normal people who bought tickets, so the 
 system we want to develop will allow to create a new entrance that uses face recognition system 
 that will help to identify which the supporter are partners and allow them to enter the 
 stadium without waiting in any line. This will facilitate the work of the security/police 
 officers that are at the entrance and allow them to focus only on the inspection 
 work and finally will motivate the people to buy those speacil passes, 
 just because it's faster and safer.
 
 A stakeholder is a person, group, or organization that has an interest or concern in a business or project. This interest or concern can be financial, strategic, operational, ethical, or any other aspect related to the success or failure of the venture. For this system the main stakeholders we see having are the developpers, the project manager, the analyst, the designers, other members of the team and the football teams (a quick side note is that we are going to focus on football clubs, but the system can be integrated with other business).
