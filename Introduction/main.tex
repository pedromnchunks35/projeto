\section{Introduction}
\quad This work was developed within the Distributed Information Systems Architecture discipline.
Initially the group focused on looking for a problem for which we would develop a solution. After discussion, the team came to an agreement that we would work on developing a solution to streamline the process for members to enter stadiums to watch the football matches of the various teams in question.
Then we try that the answer results in a distributed system, with an organized architecture.
